401 Unauthorized: Authentication failed due to an invalid API key.

404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.

500 Internal Server Error: An error occurred on the server side.

To handle errors effectively, check the status code and response message, then implement appropriate fallbacks or retry mechanisms.

Caching: To reduce load and improve performance, cache frequent API responses where appropriate.

Error Logging: Implement error logging to track and debug issues with API interactions.

Security: Always use HTTPS to encrypt your requests and protect sensitive data.
